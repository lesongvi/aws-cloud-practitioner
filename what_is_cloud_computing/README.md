# What is Cloud Computing?
- Cloud computing is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user. The term is generally used to describe data centers available to many users over the Internet. Large clouds, predominant today, often have functions distributed over multiple locations from central servers. If the connection to the user is relatively close, it may be designated an edge server.
## Shared Responsibility Model

- The shared responsibility model is a cloud security framework that dictates the security obligations of a cloud computing provider and its users to ensure accountability.

## Types of Cloud Computing

- There are three main types of cloud computing services, sometimes called the cloud computing stack because they build on top of one another. The three types are:
	- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The most basic category of cloud computing services. With IaaS, you rent IT infrastructure—servers and virtual machines (VMs), storage, networks, operating systems—from a cloud provider on a pay-as-you-go basis.
		- You need to manage the applications, data, runtime, middleware, and OSes.

	- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Platform-as-a-service (PaaS) refers to cloud computing services that supply an on-demand environment for developing, testing, delivering and managing software applications. PaaS is designed to make it easier for developers to quickly create web or mobile apps, without worrying about setting up or managing the underlying infrastructure of servers, storage, network and databases needed for development.
		- You need to manage the applications and data. The rest is managed by the cloud provider.

	- Software as a Service (SaaS): Software as a service (SaaS) is a software distribution model in which a third-party provider hosts applications and makes them available to customers over the Internet. SaaS is one of three main categories of cloud computing, alongside infrastructure as a service (IaaS) and platform as a service (PaaS).
		- You don't need to manage anything. Everything is managed by the cloud provider.
